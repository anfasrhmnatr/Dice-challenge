# Dice-challenge
It’s a simple two-player game where each player rolls a dice. After rolling, the website compares the numbers on both dice:  If Player 1’s dice has a higher number, the screen shows “Player 1 wins”.  If Player 2’s dice is higher, it shows “Player 2 wins”.  If both dice are equal, it shows a “Draw”.
